# Maintaining Trellis

Trellis owns the generic Nuxt, Convex, Better Auth, MCP, identity-forwarding,
operation, and component-bridge primitives. It must stay CMS-neutral.

## Package Surface

Publishable packages:

1. `@lupinum/trellis` from the repository root.
2. `@lupinum/trellis-bridge` from `packages/trellis-bridge`.

Do not publish `@lupinum/trellis-eslint` until it is deliberately made public.
The generated API surface in
`apps/docs/content/docs/13.api-reference/7.api-surface.md` is the source of
truth for public Trellis entrypoints.

## Daily Maintenance

Use these commands before changing public APIs, release scripts, auth, MCP,
bridge, or package metadata:

```bash
pnpm run check
pnpm run release:verify
```

`release:verify` is the full local gate. It runs formatting, lint, public
surface checks, compatibility checks, type checks, tests, e2e, starter fixture
checks, generated Convex drift checks, workspace-range pack checks, production
audit, and build.

## Release Runbook

Publishing is intentionally manual. The `release:publish` script exits with a
failure message so nobody, human or agent, can accidentally push packages to
npm.

1. Start from a clean working tree on the release branch.
2. Update package versions and compatibility data intentionally.
3. Generate release notes:

```bash
pnpm run release:notes
```

4. Review `CHANGELOG.md`. Changelogen is a draft generator, not an authority.
   Remove stale public-surface claims before continuing.
5. Run the release gate:

```bash
pnpm run release:verify
```

6. Build tarballs:

```bash
pnpm run release:pack
```

7. Inspect `.pack/*.tgz` before publishing:

```bash
tar -tzf .pack/lupinum-trellis-*.tgz | less
tar -tzf .pack/lupinum-trellis-bridge-*.tgz | less
node scripts/check-pack-workspace-refs.mjs
```

8. Commit the release prep. Do not commit `.pack/` artifacts.
9. Publish only the inspected tarballs, after the owner has reviewed npm package
   settings:

```bash
npm publish .pack/lupinum-trellis-0.1.0.tgz --access public --otp <code>
npm publish .pack/lupinum-trellis-bridge-0.1.0.tgz --access public --otp <code>
```

For the first public release of a package, npm staged publishing cannot be used
because staged publishing requires the package to already exist on the registry.
Use an owner-controlled manual publish with 2FA.

For later releases, prefer npm trusted publishing plus staged publishing:

- GitHub Actions must use a protected environment with human approval.
- The release job must use Node 24 or newer and npm 11.15 or newer.
- Do not use package-manager caches in release jobs.
- Use OIDC trusted publishing instead of long-lived npm publish tokens.
- Configure npm package settings to require 2FA and disallow traditional tokens.
- Stage the tarballs with `npm stage publish .pack/<name>.tgz`, download and
  inspect each staged package with `npm stage download <stage-id>`, then approve
  with `npm stage approve <stage-id>` and 2FA.

## Supply-Chain Policy

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` so new dependency
  versions must sit on the registry for 24 hours before fresh resolution.
- Release jobs must use the committed lockfile. Do not delete and regenerate the
  lockfile as a casual fix.
- Dependency install scripts stay explicit through pnpm's approved/ignored build
  dependency lists.
- Temporary `overrides` are local workspace policy only. Packed packages must
  not ship override policy.
- Remove an override when `pnpm why <name>` shows upstream owners resolve the
  patched version without help and `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level low` remains
  green.

## Compatibility Tuple

The supported dependency tuple is tracked in `compatibility.json`. Release
checks use that file to reject stale pins in examples, fixtures, and starter
templates.

Intentional holds:

- `h3@1.15.11` until h3 2 is stable and Nuxt ecosystem peers accept it.
- Vite 7 until Vite 8 peer support is clean across Nuxt and Vitest.
- Nuxt DevTools 3.2.4 while DevTools 4 is alpha.
- `devalue@5.8.1` is temporarily forced by workspace override until Nuxt
  carries the patched transitive version itself.

## Ownership Boundary

Trellis owns generic runtime primitives. It must not depend on Ginko CMS,
Ginko Content, private consumer apps, CMS schema concepts, or host-specific
release canaries.

When in doubt, delete or simplify. Do not add compatibility shims for unreleased
paths unless the owner explicitly asks for them.
