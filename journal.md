# Trellis RFC 0012 Implementation Journal

Date: 2026-06-17
Branch: `hardening`
Goal: implement RFC 0012 as a clean-cut Trellis app-framework refactor.

## Operating Principles

- Clean cut for unreleased/internal paths: delete old authoring paths after the
  replacement passes tests.
- Do not keep global and local security policy as parallel sources of truth.
- Keep Phase 0 narrow before touching operations, bridge, or broad mutation
  write capabilities.
- Record decisions, blockers, and verification here before each commit.

## Phase 0 Scope

1. Add required stable handler `id` metadata.
2. Add `query.session` for access/session discovery.
3. Add handler-local `reads` for `query.public`.
4. Remove global `public.readTables` as the maintained authoring path.
5. Add app-level test helper path that hides forwarding ceremony for ordinary
   calls.
6. Update starters/examples/docs to the new path.

## Decisions

- D001: `query.session` is intentionally narrow. It calls app identity/access
  helpers but does not expose arbitrary `ctx.db` in Phase 0.
- D002: `reads` is Phase 0 only for public queries. Mutation write capabilities
  stay out of scope until a focused prototype proves ergonomics.
- D003: `id` is the canonical Trellis handler subject. Existing
  `identityForwardingFunctionRef` should be removed from normal app authoring,
  not kept as a second field.

## Progress

- 2026-06-17: Finalized RFC 0012 as a greenfield clean-cut proposal.

## Blockers

- None yet.

## Verification Log

- RFC-only changes: no tests run yet.
